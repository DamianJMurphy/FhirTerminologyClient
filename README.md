# FhirTerminologyClient
Client library for the FHIR Terminology API

Note that this is work-in-progress and is not ready for production use. That is why for example there are various things hard-coded that should be configurations (such as SNOMED CT). Why there is no javadoc. And why not all of the FHIR Terminology Service API is implemented.

Dependencies: json-simple-1.1.1.jar http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjsonsimple111jar.htm

The intention is to implement client-side API calls for each of the FHIR Terminology Service operations. See http://hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/terminology-service.html

Once this Java one is done, it will be ported to C#/.Net.
